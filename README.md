# Why react

- Library, not framework - small, not complete (decision, flexible)
- React is declarative. HTML is also declarative, but for static pages. The developer writes what to show, but not how to show it. 
**Imperative programming** is a paradigm of computer programming in which the *program describes a sequence of steps* that change the state of the computer.
**Declarative programming** is a computer programming paradigm that the developer *defines what the program should accomplish* rather than explicitly defining how it should go about doing so
- Viritual DOM
- Just javascript
- React Native
- Facebook battle-tests it

# React Basic Components

**Component:** 

- Input: props or state
- Output: UI
- Like functions
- Private state
- Reusable and composable

Functions and classes can both have state and side effects, or be purely representatable. 
It's Recomended to use Functions, but classes are more powerful

**Reactive updates:** 

- When the input changes the output changes. This must be reflected in the DOM. React takes care of this

**Viritual views in memory:**

We don't write HTM. We use Javascript to generate it. 

When you get only data from server, you have two choises for doing more with that data than just html. You could enhance HTML with new things (Angular etc.). Or you could use javascript to genereate html from the data (React). 

No HTML template.

Thus, React can have a virtual representation of the DOM in memory. Because it generates the views based on js, thus in memory. (Tree reconciliation) 

React compare versions of the DOM in memory before updating the browser. 

# JSX 

React Components are not written in HTML, or JS. It's written in JSX. Which is then compiled to React API calls. One such compiler is Babel. 

```jsx
<div>Hello World</div>
```
is compiled to 
```jsx
React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World");
```
So you write something that looks like HTML, and Babel is compiling it to React API calls.

# Beginner mistakes

- Always start React Component Name with Upper Case. 
- When returning mutiple lines, use () not {}. We are not returning an object, we are returning a function call 

# onCLick Event Handler

HTML - onclick

React - onClick. 

React uses a function referende. It must be inside curly brakets {}. 
- `onclick={functionRef}` <-- Correct
- `onClick={functionRef()}` <-- WRONG: You cannot invoke the function, just use the reference (the pointer)
- `onClick={() â‡’ function()}` <-- Correct: You can put the function definition inside. Here you can use the consise Arrow function. 

# React.Fragment <></>

If you want to return multiple components, but dont want to add a new DOM element (`<div>`) you can use `<React.Fragment>`. This is so common that they have the shortcut: 

```jsx
<>  // Translates to <React.Fragment>
 <Component1 /> 
 <Component2 />
</>
```

# Props and State

**Props**
Props are similar to a list of attributes in HTML. (its explisit)
Props are fixed, immutable.
A component has a props parameter even when you havent sendt in any props. 
Props can hold functions as well, not just data. 

**State**
State is internal. But react uses it to autoreflect changes in the browser.

React can only change its internal state, not properties.

`useState()` hooks the component into the state:
```JSX
const [click, setClick] = useState(0);
```


# Responsibility Isolation 

When sending props, the components parent is in control. 
The child is just following generic rules and invoke a generic function. 
The parent control the function to be invoked. This is the isolation of resposibilities 

Developer have to answer this question alot: Where to define the state? Answer: Down in the tree as close as possible to the children that need to access that state.
